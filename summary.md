Nostrocket is a micro-DAO factory. It provides a hyper-efficient and radically fair way to collaborate on open source projects for *fun and profit*.

It's hyper-efficient because work can be done asynchronously and without [organizational mutexes](/mutexes.html).

It's [radically fair](/protocol.html) in the way that participants form consensus over the value of pull-requests and then distribute project revenue to contributors.
