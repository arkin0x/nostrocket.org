### Why Bitcoin?
There's no limit to the number of reasons why Nostrocket depends on Bitcoin, as anyone who's ever uttered *fix the money fix the world* will understand. Here are some examples:

* A free and open system requires honest price discovery, which can only happen with sound money.
* A community based on a Money that *can* be created at no cost is a community that ultimately becomes worthless.
* Nostrocket needs a source of undeniable and objective *Newtonian* truth that everyone can agree on:
    * A shared clock is required to know when things happened in the past, what's happening right now, and roughly how long till things should happen in the future.
    * Did some information exist at a certain point in time?
    * What is the current financial state of a system/organization/person/transaction/etc?
    * We cannot reason about the Nostrocket economy without a known constant of economics - Bitcoin gives us one: 21 million.
* Nostrocket requires transactions to work even when powerful actors want to censor them.
* If Nostrocket really blasts off, The Fiat Dominion will perceive it as a threat and try to kill it, so it has to be sufficiently robust. This means Nostrocket must somehow be rooted in Proof of Energy.
* Nostrocket requires some mechanism by which state can be considered *immutable* - optimising to execute and settle state as close as possible to the "bare metal" of Bitcoin allows immutability to be secured by raw energy.
* We need to know (in a way that leaves no doubt) when something doesn't work and let Nostrocket's *ideas* die instead of Nostrocket itself. Bitcoin is a source of *Darwinian* truth, and *can* act as guard rails against Darwinian mistakes - does a particular Nostrocket project produce surplus or not?
