As a [**project creator**](#), Nostrocket makes it easy for you to bring your project or idea forward to a stage where you can quit your job and focus on what really matters (despite your lack of funding).

As a [**developer**](#), Nostrocket means you get paid to work on awesome projects solving real problems.
- You can work on Nostrocket projects no matter how much or how little experience you have.
- Payments for your work are made with every pull request you send. You can choose to be paid in Sats or get a stake in the project's revenue.
- Nostrocket can only reach its full potential if everyone involved reaches theirs. Nostrocket helps you become more competent, by providing you with an opportunity to make meaningful and valuable contributions at your own [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development) and learn from others who know something you don't.

As an [**investor**](#), the Nostrocket process is a game-changer.
- Nostrocket projects do not require a middle man between your investment and the developers writing code.
- Nostrocket makes it dead simple to invest in the absolute most cutting edge projects building with Bitcoin, Lightning, and Nostr.
- Every Nostrocket project is solving a *real* and *valuable* problem.
- Funds are only spent on real problems that are in the *critical path* to generating revenue.
- Nostrocket is a *non-custodial* system - revenue generated by Nostrocket projects go straight to the shareholders. Nostrocket projects do not require an intermediary step of miscalculating profit and loss.
- You can invest as much or as little, at any time. Your investment does not go into a bucket that is then used to pay for work. Instead, your investment is paying for work that is **already** done, and you can see exactly what that work is.

Nostrocket is absolutely transparent and radically fair to project creators, contributors, and investors, for the *entire life* of the project. In order to be an ongoing process, it *must* be fair to all participants, every step of the way, from the project founder to people joining years later.

Nostrocket projects offer no scope for middlemanning and are immune to hijack by charasmatic personalities and grifters seeking to exploit the work of others. This is critical to efficiency.
