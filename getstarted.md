You can watch progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/nostrocket) for now until we replace it with a decentralized GitHub built with Nostrocket.

Reply to [this event](https://snort.social/e/note12qu5r2vnnfpn0kdw77ujxg7r2dzped0tu7038lkh0t4vv9g3vd2qjxr9c7) to receive a DM when Nostrocket is ready for blast off (probably around the end of Nostrica). Building systems like this is a challenge and the first pass is usually a clusterf*ck. If the numbers of Nostrocket projects or participants needs to be initially restricted we'll use an invite list based on the order in which people reply to this thread.
