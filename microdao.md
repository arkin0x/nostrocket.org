## What is a micro-DAO?

If you want a one-sentence definition of freedom, how about **the ability to do interesting things with other people**.

Organizations are fundamentally composed of human action (and *inter*-action), so this is the primitive we must work with to create Nostrocket.

The usefulness of a bucket exists due to the limitations or restrictions imposed by its base and sides. A bucket is useful because it holds water by creating *boundary conditions* on what the water *cannot* do while *remaining in the bucket*.

What a Nostrocket micro-DAO does with humans is analogous to what a bucket does with water. A micro-DAO is defined by the boundary conditions it places on human action - what type of action humans can perform within the organization. A micro-DAO focuses human action the same way that an ASIC focuses energy.

### DAO is a shitty term, thanks to shitcoinery

The term "DAO" has been tainted by shitcoinery and is the worst term to use, except for all the other possible terms.

No matter what term we use to describe the way that humans organise within a Nostrocket project, it can always be destroyed by a shitcoin version of it. 

Anyone who dismisses Nostrocket because it has the term "DAO" in it probably has nothing tangible to offer anyway.

### Can the shareholders in a micro-DAO conduct a rug-pull?

Maybe. And that would be a shame.

There's only **one** way to really secure a system against a rug-pull, and that's proof of energy.

Unfortunately, proof of energy is only useful for a money, and not a flexible organisation of humans performing a variety of work in pursuit of shared values.

The way that Nostrocket mitigates against this risk is to use the concept of [Votepower](/protocol.html), and [Blackball Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackballing).

It should theoretically take just *one* very determined individual within a Nostrocket micro-DAO to prevent a rug-pull.
