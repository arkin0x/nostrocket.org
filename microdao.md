## What is a micro-DAO?

If you want a one-sentence definition of freedom, how about *the ability to do interesting things with other people*. This is the point of a micro-DAO.

Organizations are fundamentally composed of human action (and *inter*-action), so this is the primitive we must work with.

The usefulness of a bucket exists due to the limitations or restrictions imposed by its base and sides. A bucket is useful because it holds water by creating *boundary conditions* on what the water *cannot* do while *remaining in the bucket*.

An ASIC provides boundary conditions on *energy* to focus it towards computing a sha256 sum for fun and profit.

A Nostrocket micro-DAO provides boundary conditions on human action to focus it towards increasing the revenue (and participation) of an open source project.

What a Nostrocket micro-DAO does with humans is analogous to what a bucket does with water and what an ASIC does with energy. 

A micro-DAO is defined by the boundary conditions it places on human action - what type of action humans can perform within the organization. 

### DAO is a shitty term, thanks to shitcoinery

The term "DAO" has been tainted by shitcoinery and is the worst term to use, except for all the other possible terms.

No matter what term we use to describe the way that humans organise within a Nostrocket project, it can always be destroyed by a shitcoin version of it. 

### Can the shareholders in a micro-DAO conduct a rug-pull?

Maybe. And that would be a shame.

There's only **one** way to really secure a system against a rug-pull, and that's proof of energy.

Unfortunately, proof of energy is only useful for a money, and not a flexible organisation of humans performing a variety of work in pursuit of shared values.

The way that Nostrocket mitigates against this risk is to use the concept of [Votepower](/protocol.html), and [Blackball Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackballing).

It should theoretically take just *one* very determined individual within a Nostrocket micro-DAO to prevent a rug-pull.
