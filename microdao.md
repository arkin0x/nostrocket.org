## What is a micro-DAO?

It's what a DAO was supposed to be like.

The term "DAO" has been tainted by shitcoinery and is the worst term to use, except for all the other possible terms.

No matter what term we use to describe the way that humans organise within a Nostrocket project, it can always be destroyed by a shitcoin version of it. 

Anyone who dismisses Nostrocket because it has the term "DAO" in it probably has nothing tangible to offer anyway.

### Can the shareholders in a micro-DAO conduct a rug-pull?

Maybe. And that would be a shame.

There's only **one** way to really secure a system against a rug-pull, and that's proof of energy.

Unfortunately, proof of energy is only useful for a money, and not a flexible organisation of humans performing a variety of work in pursuit of shared values.

The way that Nostrocket mitigates against this risk is to use the concept of Votepower, and Blackball Voting.

It should theoretically take just **one** very determined individual within a Nostrocket micro-DAO to prevent a rug-pull.
